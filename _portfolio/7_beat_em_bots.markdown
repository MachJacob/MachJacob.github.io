<center><b>Beat 'Em Bots</b> is the result of a short game jam on my university course.</center>

#### Beat 'Em Bots
The theme of this game jam was The Foundry, a space on the university, and education. We decided to make a game that could teach some basics of programming, by having controllable robots that players can set commands for, then watch them fight. The game was intended to be displayed in a hallway, so anyone could walk up and start playing, so the commands were kept simple: move, block, jump and attack, but there was an in-depth combo system for people to explore.
