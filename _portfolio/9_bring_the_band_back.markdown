<center><b>Bring the Band Back</b> was my submission for the Global Game Jam 2021, with a team of three other people.</center>

#### Bring the Band Back
The theme of the jam was "Lost and Found", and we decided to create a game where music was lost, and the player had to find members of their band. As they added to their party, they unlocked new abilities and the band member's instrument would be added to the music.
