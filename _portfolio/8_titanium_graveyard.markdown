<center><b>Titanium Graveyard</b> was my submission for the Global Game Jam 2020, with a team of four other people.</center>

#### Bring the Band Back
The theme of the jam was "Repair", and in our game the player is an engineer who is entering a derelict spaceship to repair it. As they traverse the zero-gravity environment, everything touched with respond, including the very ship itself. Hostile aliens lurk in the darkness, and the player must manage them and the shifting environment in their quest.
