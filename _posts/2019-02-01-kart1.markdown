We are making good progress on the alpha build for Mario Kart. My work has primarily been on the power ups, of which I have implemented the banana, green shell and boost mushroom. I am considering doing something for the customisation of characters, but I need to research how to do that.

One thing I'm enjoying about our group is that we have someone filling a leadership role, something that I feel is missing from my other group project currently. I look forward to continuing this project and the one in the Scarle Engine with them.
