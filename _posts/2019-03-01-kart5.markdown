Collision response is tricky. The way I previously implemented collision detection, using DirectX's collision library, won't work for applying the forces of a collision. The DirectX collision functions only say what type of collision happened, while I need to be able to use the collision normal, and the point of the collision to calculate the impulse. I think I'm going to need to write my own detection logic so that I can have access to this information.

I have found a wonderfully helpful book though: *Physics for Game Developers* by David M. Bourg and Bryan Bywalec.
