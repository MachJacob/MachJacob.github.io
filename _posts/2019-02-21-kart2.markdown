I've volunteered to handle all of the physics and collisions for this project. I know it's an ambitious task, but it is likely that this is all I will work on for the project.

Having a look around in the basic physics already provided for us, I can see a simple way to add gravity. Just set the base velocity to (0, -9.8, 0) multiplied by a gravity boolean each tick.

I have also added a simple AddForce() function, which does exactly what it says. It has two overloads, one of which takes a vector3, and another that takes three floats, for whichever version people want to use.

In the way of bad news, the groups have shuffled slightly. I am a little bit upset at this, because our leader changed to a different group, and I enjoyed working with him.
